# Project Aurora
Don't like Gnome but want the all the goodies the awesome Bluefin Image provides? Aurora is Bluefin but with KDE instead Gnome as a desktop environment.

**This image is considered Alpha!** 

-Website coming soon-

A familiar(ish) desktop for KDE fans, but with all the developer goodness built-in. It strives to cover these three use cases:
- For end users it provides a system as reliable as a Chromebook with near-zero maintainance, with the power of Ubuntu and Fedora fused together
- For developers we endeavour to provide the best cloud-native developer experience by enabling easy consumption of the [industry's leading tools](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?sort=stars). These are included in dedicated `bluefin-dx` and `bluefin-dx-nvidia` images
- For gamers we strive to deliver a world-class Flathub gaming experience

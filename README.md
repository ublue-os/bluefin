**Bluefin** is a cloud-native desktop operating system that reimagines the Linux desktop experience for modern computing environments. Built on immutable infrastructure principles and leveraging container-native technologies, Bluefin delivers enterprise-grade reliability and developer-focused workflows.

For end users, it provides a system as reliable as a Chromebook with near-zero maintenance. For developers, it offers a powerful cloud-native developer workflow with integrated container tools, declarative system management, and seamless CI/CD integration. Check [Introduction to Bluefin](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/introduction/) for a feature walkthrough.

## Mission

Bluefin's mission is to provide a robust, cloud-native desktop operating system that bridges the gap between consumer usability and enterprise-grade infrastructure practices. We aim to deliver:

- **Reliability**: Immutable, atomic updates ensuring system stability
- **Developer Experience**: Integrated cloud-native tooling and workflows
- **Sustainability**: Reduced maintenance overhead through declarative system management
- **Accessibility**: Desktop Linux that's approachable for users transitioning from traditional operating systems

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- **Immutable Desktop OS**: Container-based, atomic desktop operating system
- **Cloud-Native Tooling**: Integration with Kubernetes, containers, and CNCF ecosystem
- **Developer Workflows**: Optimized development environments and DevOps tooling
- **Hardware Support**: Broad hardware compatibility including NVIDIA, HWE, ASUS, and Surface devices
- **Security**: Secure Boot support, signed images, and supply chain security
- **User Experience**: Modern desktop environment with simplified system management

### Out of Scope

- **Server Operating Systems**: Focused exclusively on desktop/workstation use cases
- **Mobile Platforms**: Not targeting mobile or embedded systems
- **Legacy Application Support**: Emphasis on containerized and modern application delivery
- **Custom Kernel Development**: Based on upstream Fedora kernels with minimal modifications

## Getting Started

Visit [projectbluefin.io](https://projectbluefin.io/#scene-picker) to explore installation options and get started with Bluefin.

### Secure Boot

Secure Boot is supported by default on our systems, providing an additional layer of security. After the first installation, you will be prompted to enroll the secure boot key in the BIOS.

Enter the password `universalblue`
when prompted to enroll our key.

If this step is not completed during the initial setup, you can manually enroll the key by running the following command in the terminal:

`
ujust enroll-secure-boot-key
`

Secure boot is supported with our custom key. The pub key can be found in the root of the akmods repository [here](https://github.com/ublue-os/akmods/raw/main/certs/public_key.der).
If you'd like to enroll this key prior to installation or rebase, download the key and run the following:

```bash
sudo mokutil --timeout -1
sudo mokutil --import public_key.der
```

> "Evolution is a process of constant branching and expansion." - Stephen Jay Gould

#A familiar(ish) Ubuntu desktop for Fedora Kinoite. It strives to cover these two use cases. For end users it provides a system as reliable as a Chromebook with near-zero maintainance, with the power of Ubuntu and Fedora fused together. For gamers we strive to deliver a world-class Flathub gaming experience. The name comes from the projects Finite is based on. Fin(Bluefin)ite(Kinoite).

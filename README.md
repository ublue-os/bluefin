> "Evolution is a process of constant branching and expansion." - Stephen Jay Gould

A familiar(ish) Ubuntu desktop for Fedora Silverblue. It strives to cover these two use cases. For end users it provides a system as reliable as a Chromebook with near-zero maintainance, with the power of Ubuntu and Fedora fused together. For gamers we strive to deliver a world-class Flathub gaming experience. Check [Introduction to Bluefin](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/introduction-to-bluefin/41) for a feature walkthrough.

Aurora is a delightful KDE desktop experience for end-users that are looking for reliability and developers for the most-hassle free setup. Zero maintenance included.

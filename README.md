A familiar(ish) Ubuntu desktop for Fedora Silverblue. It strives to cover these three use cases:
- For end users it provides a system as reliable as a Chromebook with near-zero maintainance, with the power of Ubuntu and Fedora fused together
- For developers we endeavour to provide the best cloud-native developer experience by enabling easy consumption of the [industry's leading tools](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?sort=stars). These are included in dedicated `bluefin-dx` and `bluefin-dx-nvidia` images
- For gamers we strive to deliver a world-class Flathub gaming experience
